## A realistic view of AI 

[video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone/lecture/BYHnY/a-realistic-view-of-ai)

### Goldilocks rule for AI

- Too optimistic: Sentient / super-intelligent AI killer robot coming soon
- Too pessimistic: AI cannot do everything, so an AI winter is coming (AI overhype by media)
- Just rigth: AI can't do everything, but will transform industries

### Limitiation of AI

- Performance limitations - call center
- Explainability is hard (but somtime doable) - AI sometime is hard to explain what is wrong.
- Biased AI through baised data 
- Adversarial attacks on AI 


## Discrimination / Bias

[video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone/lecture/r8dGg/discrimination-bias)

AI learning unhealthy streotypes if we train AI from internet.

Why bias matters

- Hiring tool that discrimination against women
- Facial recognition working better for light-skinned that dark-skinned individuals
- Bank loan approval
- Toxic effect of reinforcing unhealthy streotypes


Combating bias

- Technical solutions: 
  - "zero out" the bias word 
  - Use less baised and/ore more inclusive data - if we want to create face recognition use dataset from every etnic group and gender
- Transparency and/or auditing processes
- Diverse workforce
  -  Creates less biases applications


## Adversarial attacks on AI

[video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone/lecture/RgA2q/adversarial-attacks-on-ai)

Adversarial attack fool AI with change value of input we as human cant see, such as change pixel bit in the image of Hummingbird and AI will give output Hammer.

Adversarial defenses

- Defenses do exist, but incur some cost
- Similiar to spam vs anti-spam, we may be in an arms race for some applications


## Adverser uses of AI

[video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone/lecture/NcnS3/adverse-uses-of-ai)

Adverses uses of AI

- DeepFakes
  - Synthesize video of people doing things they never did
- Undermining of democracy and privacy
  - Oppressive surveillance
- Generating fake comments
- Spam vs anti-spam and fraud vs anti-fraud
- 

## AI and developing economies

[video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone/lecture/e4lNq/ai-and-developing-economies)


How developing economies can build AI

- US and China are leading, but all AI communities are still immature
- Focus on AI to strengthen a country's vertical industries
- Public-private partnerships to accelerate development
- Invest in education

## AI and Jobs

AI is automation on steroids - andrew ng.

Some sulitions to handle job replace by AI.

- Conditional basic income: provide a safety net but incentive learning
- Lifelong learning society 
- Political solution - create legislation to navigate incoming
