# Building AI Project

## Workflow of a machine learning project

[Video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone/lecture/z6hU1/workflow-of-a-machine-learning-project)

### The Steps

1. Collect Data
2. Train Model (use Machine Learning to input to output or A to B Mapping)
3. Deploy the model 
      
      -  Get data back maintain / update model

Example project:

__Self-driving car__:
1. Collect data - Take picture the front of cars (A) - Predict position of other cars (B)
2. Train Model - Iterate many times until good enough
3. Deploy model - Get data back, Maintain/ update model

## Workflow of a data science project

Unlike a machine learning project, the output of a data science project is often a set of actionable insights, a set of insights that may cause you to do things differently.

### The Steps

1. Collect data
2. Analyze data  - iterate many times to get good insights
3. Suggest hypotheses/actions
    
    - Deploy changes
    - Re-analyze new data periodically

## Every job function needs to learn how to use data

You can change every repetitif job with AI/ML
