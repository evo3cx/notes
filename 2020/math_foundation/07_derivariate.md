## Derivative Concepts

is tell as how much equation changes in direction of slope curve of rate of direction

- Geometrics Prespective
The derivative is slope of a curve

- Pysical Prespective
The derivative the rate of change


### The Basic

Th derivative operator is written as: `d\dx`


## Scalar Derivative Rules

Constant `(d\dx)c = 0` `Example: (d/dx)62 = 0`
