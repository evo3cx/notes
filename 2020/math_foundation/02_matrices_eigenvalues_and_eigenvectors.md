# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

## Motivation

Eigenvalue deompoisition is used in **principle component analysis (PCA)** 

PCA is a statical procedure that is used to convert a set of observation of possible correlated variable 
into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components

in other words, PCA is a method of `summarizing` the data or `compressing` the data.

## Eigendecomposition

Breaking mathematical objects into their constituent parts!

We can decompose matrices in ways that reveals information about their function properties that is not immediately obvious from the representation of the matrix as an array of elements


The eigenvector of a square matrix **A** is a nonzero vector *v* such that multiplication by **A** alters only the of **v**

`Av == scalar(v)`

*v* the eigenvector
**scalar** a scalar, the eigenvalue corresponding to *v*


Properties:
1. Not every matrix can decompose into eigenvalues and eigenvectors
2. A matrix is singular(the inverse does not exists) if any of the eigenvalues are zero
3. A matrix whose eigenvalues are all positive is called positive definite
