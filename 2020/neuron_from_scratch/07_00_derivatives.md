# Derivatives

- Derivatives its a algorightm to searching for optimal weights and biases effectively.

## How Derivatives help us

Each weight and bias may also have different degrees of influence on the loss — this influence depends on the parameters themselves as well as on the current sample, which is an input to the first layer. These input values are then multiplied by the weights, so the input data affects the neuron’s output and affects the impact that the weights make on the loss. The same principle applies to the biases and parameters in the next layers, taking the previous layer’s outputs as inputs.

# Slope

Slope is a impact that `x` have on `y` with formula.

```
Change in `y` /  Change in `x` 

```

# The Numerical Derivative

Method to calculating the derivative is called **numerical differentiation** - calculating the slope of the tangent line using two infinitely close points.

# The Analytic Derivative
