Key Takeway:
1. Bad programmer think to much about code, Good programmer think about data structure and their relantionship
2. Bad database -> Bad backend -> bad frontend
2. Migration/Change schema are hard
3. NoSQL/Mongodb created because people didnt need to migration a schema, but mongodb such because doenst had schema.
4. Schema its good, cuz enforcing consistency and structure is good
5. What users of software want on the frontend is reliability and fast, responsive performance, and that's impossible without a well-structured and well-functioning backend.
