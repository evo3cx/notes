Rust is not a good C replacement: https://drewdevault.com/2019/03/25/Rust-is-not-a-good-Ca-replacement.html

Takeaway keys:
1. Rust release many new features per year, if you write rust app last year already looks outdated, if you want up-to-date with Rust and solve your proble idiomatically.
2. Rust is written to replace C++ and solve problem with adding new features
3. C has a spec and rust doesnt
4. C is the most protable programming language
5. C has a consistent & stable ABI but Rust on the other hand, has no stable internal ABI
6. Cargo is mandatory
7. Concurrency is generally a bad thing. serial programs have X problems, and prallel program have X^Y problems, where Y is the amount of parallelism you introdce.
8. C is far from the prefect language - it has many flaws. However, its replacement should be simpler not more complex, author think Rust is too complex.
